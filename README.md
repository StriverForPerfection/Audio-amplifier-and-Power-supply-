# Audio amplifier and Power supply 
Here reside the LTSpice files containing the designs for both the audio amplifier and the Linear Power Supply.

*Please, disregard the fact that the amplifier's simulation yields that the output will be clipped. In the [design](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16WAyyiq6l0-Nx_WczG5hBoLBlHGEg-l6?usp=sharing) implemented in real life, no clipping occurs (at least before a gain of 5).*
